# FHIR API implementation

* Status: accepted
* Date: 2022-06-11

## Context and Problem Statement

We would like to bootstrap our development by adopting an Open-Source implementation of FHIR API server. Which project should we pick as foundational?

## Considered Options

* HAPI FHIR
* Microsoft FHIR server

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "HAPI FHIR", because HAPI FHIR is the most widely used, standards compliant implementation of FHIR API server. It has a wide and active Open Source community with excellent documentation and examples to follow. 
Microsoft FHIR server is relatively new. It also has tight connections to Azure ecosystem.
